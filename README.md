# Doppl Fork

This is a fork of the RxAndroid library to provide tests and modifications to support 
iOS development with J2objc using the [Doppl build framework](http://doppl.co/).

## Versions

[1.2.1](https://github.com/doppllib/RxAndroid/tree/v1.2.1)

## Usage

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'io.reactivex:rxandroid:1.2.1'
    doppl 'co.doppl.io.reactivex:rxandroid:1.2.1.4'
}
```

## Status

Stable. No known memory issues. RxJava itself has memory leaks, just fyi.

## Library Development

See [docs](http://doppl.co/docs/createlibrary.html) for an overview of our setup and repo org for forked library development.
